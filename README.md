Video Game Sales Prediction

This project is a machine learning application designed to predict video game sales using historical data. The dataset contains information about various video games, including genre, publisher, release year, platform, and sales in different regions. By leveraging this data, we build models to forecast sales and gain insights into key factors that influence game performance.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Gain insights into video game sales trends and identify patterns in the data.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numeric features.
Model Building and Evaluation:
Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict sales with high accuracy.
Feature Importance Analysis:
Determine the key factors that influence video game sales.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3
Libraries and Frameworks:
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on video game sales across various platforms, including details like:

Game name
Platform
Genre
Year of release
Publisher
Sales in North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions
Ensure you have the dataset ready in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV) before running the project.
